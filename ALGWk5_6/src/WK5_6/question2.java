// An initially empty stack S has performed a total of 25 push operations,
// 12 top operations, and 10 pop operations, 3 of which returned null to indicate that
// it is an empty stack.
	
// Utilizing the above question, we are able to see the important factors that are at play.
// these mostly include the "pushes" and the pops."
// Though we do not know the correct order ant which all of these sequences were to happen.
// We can make a rough estimate that the final numeric value would be:
// 25 - 10 = 15
